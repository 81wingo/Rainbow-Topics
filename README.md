# Coding Rainbow Topics

This repo is for tracking Coding Rainbow topics.  You can [browse existing suggestions](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Rainbow-Topics/issues) as well as [suggest topics](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Rainbow-Topics/issues/new).  The suggestions can also just be programming questions (general or about specific code) will I'll answer in my "Q&A" series.

In addition, you can use the "github issue" reactions (thumbs up) to upvote suggestions.
